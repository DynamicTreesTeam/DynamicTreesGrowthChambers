# Growth Chambers
Growth chambers for [Dynamic Trees](https://github.com/ferreusveritas/DynamicTrees). Originally created by [Ferreus Veritas](https://github.com/ferreusveritas/), found [here](https://github.com/ferreusveritas/CCCollection/tree/master/growingtanks), adapted for 1.16 by myself in this repository. 

See [this page](https://github.com/ferreusveritas/DynamicTrees/wiki/Growth-Chambers) for a guide on how to use them.
